# verifica-cpf
A simple Pascal program for finding the verifying digits of the CPF (Cadastro de Pessoa Física), which is the Brazilian individual taxpayer registry identification.
This was a simple program during my course of Introduction to Computing in 2009 at the Federal University of São Carlos, Brazil.
